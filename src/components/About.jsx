        <p>
          Hello! I’m <strong>Annu Sandhu</strong>, a computer science student and aspiring frontend developer with a passion for building clean and responsive web applications using React, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm currently pursuing my <strong> Masters of Computer Science (Software)</strong> from Kurukshetra University (2024-Present) .
          </p>
        <p>
          With a curious mind and an artistic soul, I love exploring both traditional crafts and digital creativity.  
          When I'm not immersed in colors or textures, I enjoy coding interactive websites that reflect artistic expression and visual harmony.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey is about blending art with technology — and I’m just getting started.
